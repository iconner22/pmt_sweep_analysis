# pmt_sweep_analysis
User Interface for PMT Calibration using LED and HV Sweep

## High Voltage Graph
This graph displays the relationship between the PMT gain and the applied voltage. 
This relationship is fit with a quadratic curve and the equation is displayed.

## LED Graph
This graph display the gain values across the mean photoelectron values across the LED Sweep.
This shows the stability of the PMT across light intensities. This stability is displayed in the side panel.

## Ideal Gain Entry
This features allows the user to enter an ideal gain and it calculates the necessary voltage based on the fitted equation.
